We see a list of trainers with default filter of location. 
We see a list of trainers with their brief introduction such as Picture, Name, Gym Locations, Introduction, workout tags
We should be able to filer trainers by workout type (yoga, bodybuilding etc), location, Price, Gender
Once we click the specific trainer, the page is redirect to Trainer Page.
